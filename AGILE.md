# **Re.view- Agile development**
## **Agile overview**

For this project, i took on an agile approach in in order to sort the workload into more managable chunks, with the help of a kanban board, and the code institute walk through project to get an idea on what I wanted to make.

## **Sprints**

### **First Sprint**
#### **1st May-9th May**
This first sprint was spent creating my drf repo, planning what my project would be, and how I would go about implementing the changes I wanted to make.
I followed the Code Institute drf-api video and made changes where necessary to get my project to full functionality and began thinking how I would implement them on the front end

### **Second Sprint** 
#### **May 9th - May 16th
This sprint I focused on the user stories focused on authentication navigation and conditional rending.
As I wasnt fully comfortable with React as a whole I have used and modified the code from the walkthrough to help me put together a MVP or a minimal viable product to help me test that features worked and to give my project structure.

The User Stories I covered in this sprint are under the categories below:

**NAVIGATION & AUTHENTICATION:**

This sprint on focused on being able to let the user, log in, log out, 


### **Third Sprint**
#### **May 16th - May 22nd**

This sprint I focused on the User stories to do with the PRODUCTS, LIKES AND UNLIKES and REVIEWS.
I used the bassline code from the walkthrough moments project, to give my PRODUCTS functionality and to gauge user interaction via the like, dislike, and review/comment function

### **Fourth Spring**
#### **May 22nd - May 28th**
This spring was focused on completing the stylings and Readme, while also Finishing off the PROFILE user stories. 
giving the user the ability to adjust their profile, display their products, follow other users, unfollow other users and upload a profile picture


## **User Story Notes**
Using user stories I was able to firmly grasp the functionality I had achieved in my app, with the help of the Moments app, I was able to achieve what i believe is a finished product.
